# Dockerfile Generator

This tool automatically generates a Dockerfile, a .dockerignore file, and a docker-compose.yml for your application based on its folder contents. It supports several common application types—such as React, Node.js, Python, or generic applications—and creates a tailored configuration to streamline your Docker containerization process.

## Features

- **Automatic App Detection:**  
  Scans your application folder for key files (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, or `.py` files) to determine the appropriate Dockerfile template.

- **Multi-Template Support:**  
  Generates different Dockerfile configurations depending on the detected app type:
  - **React Applications:** Uses a multi-stage build to create an optimized production image with Node.js for building and Nginx for serving.
  - **Node.js Applications:** Creates a Dockerfile that installs dependencies and starts the app with a suitable command.
  - **Python Applications:** Provides a Dockerfile that installs required packages and runs your Python app.
  - **Generic Applications:** Offers a basic Dockerfile template for projects that don’t fit into the above categories.

- **Complementary Files:**  
  In addition to the Dockerfile, the tool generates:
  - **.dockerignore:** Excludes unnecessary files and directories (e.g., git directories, node_modules, etc.) to speed up Docker builds.
  - **docker-compose.yml:** Sets up a simple Docker Compose service configuration for easier container orchestration.

## Installation

This project includes both a PowerShell version for Windows users and a Bash (Node.js) version for Unix-based systems.

### Windows (PowerShell)

1. Run the `install_dockerfile_gen_ps.txt` script.
2. The installer will:
   - Copy the main PowerShell script to your installation directory.
   - Create a batch file to execute the script.
   - Optionally, prompt to create a desktop shortcut.
   - Add the installation directory to your PATH for easy access.
3. Once installed, you can generate Docker files by running:

   ```powershell
   dockerfile-gen C:\path\to\your\app
   ```

### Unix-Based Systems (Bash)

1. Run the `install_dockerfile_gen_sh.txt` script.
2. The installer will:
   - Create the installation directory (typically in your home folder).
   - Install the Node.js-based Dockerfile generator script.
   - Create a symbolic link in `/usr/local/bin` or `~/.local/bin` to allow global access.
   - Update your PATH if necessary.
3. To generate Docker files, use:

   ```bash
   dockerfile-gen /path/to/your/app
   ```

## Usage

After installation, run the tool by providing the path to your application folder. The tool will:
- Detect the application type.
- Generate the Dockerfile, `.dockerignore`, and `docker-compose.yml` in the target folder.

For example:

```bash
dockerfile-gen /path/to/your/app
```

To start your Docker container using Docker Compose, simply run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Supported Application Types

- **React:**  
  Multi-stage build using Node.js for building and Nginx for serving static files.

- **Node.js:**  
  Standard Dockerfile for running a Node application, with auto-detection of the start command and port.

- **Python:**  
  Dockerfile tailored for Python applications, installing dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

- **Generic:**  
  A basic Dockerfile template based on Ubuntu for projects that do not fit into the above categories.
